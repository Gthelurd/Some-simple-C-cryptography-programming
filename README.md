# Simple Encryption and Decryption in C
This repository contains a collection of simple C programs for password encoding and decoding using various encryption methods. The implemented encryption techniques include:
- Atbash Cipher: A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced with its corresponding letter from the end of the alphabet.
- Caesar Cipher: A substitution cipher that shifts the letters of the plaintext by a certain number of positions down the alphabet.
- A1Z26 Cipher: A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced with its corresponding position in the alphabet.
- Vigen√®re Cipher: A polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword.

Each encryption method is implemented as a separate C program within this repository. The programs are written in C and are compatible with the CodeBlocks compiler.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the desired encryption method's directory.
3. Compile the C program using the CodeBlocks compiler.
4. Run the compiled program and follow the on-screen instructions to encrypt or decrypt passwords.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or additional encryption methods to suggest, please feel free to submit a pull request.
